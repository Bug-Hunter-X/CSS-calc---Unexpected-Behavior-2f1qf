The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely cause issues because the second term lacks a unit.  Another problem occurs when using `calc()` with nested calculations, and the order of operations might not be intuitive.  Combining `calc()` with other CSS properties that expect units, such as `margin` or `padding`, can also cause errors if the resulting value from `calc()` is not a valid unit (e.g., a percentage followed by a pixel value).
